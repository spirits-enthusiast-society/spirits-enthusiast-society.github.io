  <h2>What is alcohol (a review)</h2>

  <p>
    Distillation is a very simple process whereby more volatile alcohol is seperated from less volatile elements by applying heat to beer or wine (which is called a wash)
  </p>
  <p>
    The guiding principle behind distillation is that alcohol evaporates at 173° and water evaporates at 212°. Therefore we are able to trap the resultant alcohol vapors then cool them back into a liquid.
  </p>

  <h2>Alcohol in Ireland</h2>

  <p>
    It is thought that Irish Monks picked up distillation from their travels to the Meditarranean and the Middle East. They brought it back and modified it to produce a drinkable spirit in the 12th century.
  </p>
  <p>
    Old Bushmills distillery claims to be the oldest distillery in the world, receiving it&#8217;s license from James I in 1608.
  </p>

  <p>
    When Alfred Barnard visited Ireland in 1885 researching for his book &#8220;The Whisky Distilleries of the United Kingdom&#8221;, the number of legal distillers was 28. At the time, Irish Whisky was considered the finest in the world.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Dublin &#8220;Big Four&#8221;, John Jameson &amp; Son of Bow Street, John Power &amp; Son of John&#8217;s Lane, George Roe &amp; Co. of Thomas Street, and Willam Jameson &amp; Co. of Marrowbone Lane, had a combined output of 5 Million Gallons per year, compared to an average of below 100,000 gallons at their fellow distilleries in Scotland.
  </p>

  <h2>The Decline of Irish Whiskey</h2>

  <p>
    The institution of the Irish Free State created a huge trade war with Great Britain, the main market for Irish Whiskey.
  </p>

  <p>
    Prohibition in the Unites States also cut off a huge market for Irish Whiskey, as there were 6 million Irish living in the US after the Great Famine of the 1840s.
  </p>

  <p>
    During Prohibition, many bootleggers would mark their Whiskey as &#8220;Irish&#8221;, it being the finest in the world, which effectively ruined the reputation of Irish Whiskey after Prohibition was over.
  </p>

  <p>
    In those years, most of the smaller establishments closed for good. Only the larger companies were able to shut down production and wait for better times. In the 1930s, Old Midleton Distillery produced only for two weeks per year.
  </p>

  <p>
    Of the 28 distillers from 1885, only Bushmills Distillery remains having closed and reopened a few times during it&#8217;s history.
  </p>

  <h2>Consolidation</h2>

  <p>
    Jamison, Powers, and Cork Distilleries were forced to consolidate and form the Irish Distillers Group in 1966, shutting down operations in Dublin and moving to a state-of-the-art facility in Middleton. They acquired Bushmills in 1970 and at the time controlled all Whiskey produced in Ireland.
  </p>

  <p>
    This changed in 1987 when the Cooley distillery was founded by John Teeling.
  </p>

  <p>
    Today these are the three major distilleries in operation in Ireland: Old Bushmills, New Middleton, and Cooley.
  </p>

  <h2>Whisky by the barrel, not by the bottle</h2>

  <p>Even though there are only three distilleries in Ireland, there are several independant brands that buy Whiskey from a distillery and then age it and/or blend it and then bottle it.</p>

  <p>Each distillery also has several brands.</p>

  <h2>Blended Whiskey</h2>

  <p>Blended : Jameson, Bushmills, Powers, Paddy</p>

  <p>Blended Whiskey is made by mixing spirit made in column stills and pot stills. Column Stills are more efficient, Pot Stills produced more flavorful results. Blends are cheaper to produce.</p>

  <h2>Single Malt : Knappogue Castle, Palace 9</h2>

  <p>Those made entirely from malted barley distilled in a pot still are referred to as single malt whiskeys, a style also very commonly associated with Scotch whisky</p>

  <h2>Single Pot Still : Yellow Spot, Redbreast</h2>

  <p>The second style of Irish pot still whiskey is single pot still whiskey, made from a mixture of malted and unmalted barley completely distilled in a pot still.</p>

  <h2>Whiskey's Tasted</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Yellow Spot</li>
    <li>Redbreast Cask Strength</li>
    <li>Palace Bar 9</li>
    <li>Knoppogue 12</li>
  </ul>
