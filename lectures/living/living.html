<h2 class="living title">Welcome to the Living Room Lecture Series!</h1>

<p class="living text">The Living Room Lecture Series was conceived as a way to introduce students to the expansive and sometimes confusing world of alcohol and its accoutrement.

Through the following educational presentations, the Spirits Enthusiast Society hopes to enrich your responsible enjoyment of satisfying beverages.</p>
