  	<h2>Act I: An Introduction to Whiskey</h2>
    <h3>Scene 1: American Whiskey</h3>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h4>What is "Whiskey?"</h4>
    <p>
      Whiskey is distilled alcholic beverage made from a fermented grain mash aged in wooden barrels. "Whiskey" is the spelling and terminology for this type of spirit made in North America. "Whisky" is the term for this type of spirit from Scotland and Ireland (though Ireland actually uses both).

    <h4>How to Make Alcohol
    	(Or more acurately, Ethanol)</h4>
    <p>
      Distillation is a very simple process whereby more volatile alcohol is seperated from less volatile elements by applying heat to beer or wine (which is called a wash).</br></br>
    </p>
    <p>
      The guiding principle behind distillation is that alcohol evaporates at 173° and water evaporates at 212°. Therefore we are able to trap the resultant alcohol vapors then cool them back into a liquid.

    <h4>How to make Whiskey</h4>
    <p>
      The first step to making whiskey is to create a "mash". A mash is a combination of grains steeped in hot water to activate malt enzymes and convert grain starches into fermentable sugars.
    </p>

    <p>
      After this process of "mashing", you have a sugar rich solution called a "wort" (pronounced "wert").
    </p>
    <p>
      Yeast is added to begin the fermentation process. Fermentation is a biological process in which the sugars (glucose, fructose, and sucrose) are converted into ethanol and carbon dioxide. The fermented wort is called the "wash".
    </p>
    <img src="/img/ferment.jpg" alt="fermenting wort" class="lecture image-medium">
    <p>
      When fermentation is complete, the wash is strained into a still (the device that will distille the wash) to remove any large solids. The remaining wash that goes into the still is mostly ethanol and water.
    </p>

    <p>
      After the ethanol (ethanol is the only type of alcohol that can be "safely" consumed) is separated, we have moonshine or white whiskey. This spirit is then poured into a charred oak barrel called a cask. After the cask is sealed, the whiskey is aged, then diluted and bottled.

    <h3>Scene 2: Rye</h3>
    <p>
    	At the time of his death in 1799, Washington’s estate was the largest producer of whiskey in the country, turning out 11,000 gallons a year. It is our nations oldest spirit (*Not fact checked).
    </p>

    <p>
      To be called a "Rye" the mash bill must contain at least 51% Rye, it must not be distilled higher than 160 proof, and it must not be barreled at higher than 125 proof. </br></br>
      While 51% is a traditional mixture of Rye, modern Rye mash bills can have a much higher percentage of Rye.

    <h3> Scene 3: Bourbon</h3>
    <h4>Elijah Craig or Jacob Spears?</h4>
    <p>
      Many legends exist of how Bourbon was created. Some say it was the Baptist pioneer distiller Elijah Craig. Some say it was the distiller Jacob Spears.</p>
	<img src="/img/elijah-craig-woodcut.png" alt="Elijah Craig" class="lecture image-medium">
    <p>
      In reality, there probably was no single inventor of Bourbon. Most likely the local European immigrants of Bourbon county Virginia (now Kentucky), used European methods (charred barrels) and American ingredients (corn) to create the spirit.</br></br>

      Today 97% of all Bourbon is made somewhere close to Bardstown, KY.
    </p>
    <img src="/img/bourbon.png" alt="Bourbon" class="lecture image-medium">
    <ul>
      <li>Four Roses Distillery in Lawrenceburg</li>
      <li>Heaven Hill Distillery in Bardstown</li>
      <li>Jim Beam Distillery in Clermont</li>
      <li>Maker's Mark Distillery in Loretto</li>
      <li>Town Branch Bourbon in Lexington</li>
      <li>Wild Turkey Distillery in Lawrenceburg</li>
      <li>Woodford Reserve Distillery near Versailles</li>
      <li>(Sazerac) Buffalo Trace Distillery in Frankfort</li>
    </ul>
</br>
    <p>
      While most modern Bourbons are made in central Kentucky, the Term "Bourbon" can apply to any American whiskey that follows this recipe:</br></br>

    <ul>
      <li>Mash bill must be at least 51% corn</li>
      <li>Must not be distilled higher than 160 proof</li>
      <li>Must not be barreled higher than 125 proof</li>
      <li>Must be aged in charred new oak barrels</li>
    </ul></p>

    <h4>"Straight" Bourbon</h4>
    <p>
    	In order to be referred to as a "straight" bourbon, it must have been aged in the barrel for a minimum of two years and can not have any added coloring or any other added spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
    	And, of course, to be called a "Kentucky" whiskey it must be made in Kentucky.
